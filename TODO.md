# To Do

## Now


## Next

- Move `protocols.py` stuff into `models.py`
- Get rid of `themester/sphinx/resource.py`
- Make `make_page_context` into a factory
- `SphinxConfig` as a service
- Adam's `PageContext`
- Get `PathTo` into templates as the real `pathto`

## Soon

- Copy static assets to destination
- toc
- View lookup as a service
- ChainMap implementation

## Eventually

- Register a StaticDest because Sphinx wants _static instead of static
- Nullster
- Goku
- Sphinx-independent PathTo and friends
- Decorators
- Operators
- Injection
- Events
- Docs
- Predicate-based lookup
- Layout Themes
- Use the `uv` backend instead of `hatchling`
- Remove all the Hopscotch stuff that will never get used, sigh

## Done

- TemplateBridge, html-page-context, and builder-init
