# To Do

## Now

- Remove all the Hopscotch stuff that will never get used, sigh

## Next

- Get `PathTo` into templates as the real `pathto`
- `SphinxConfig` as a service
- Adam's `PageContext`

## Soon

- Copy static assets to destination
- toc
- View lookup as a service
- ChainMap implementation

## Eventually

- Register a StaticDest because Sphinx wants _static instead of static
- Nullster
- Goku
- Sphinx-independent PathTo and friends
- Decorators
- Operators
- Injection
- Events
- Docs
- Predicate-based lookup
- Layout Themes

## Done

- TemplateBridge, html-page-context, and builder-init
